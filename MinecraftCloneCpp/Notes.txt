Summary
---------
We need to send Vertex data to the GPU which is used by the shader programs to display the data onto the screen.
The vertex data is the input to the Graphic pipeline, this data contains the vertices that will be used to create elements on the
screen. 

The Vertex data is sent to the Vertex Shader. This is done by using an openGL vertex buffer. We first generate the vertex buffer
this buffer is meant to be a Array Buffer type. We bind this buffer and pass its type as an arguement so the GPU knows to make 
room for the data of the specified type. You can have multiple buffers of different types, but each type can only have one buffer.
We then send the data to the GPU. We also have to specify what the data in the buffer represents and how it will be relevant to 
the shader. We do this by using attribute pointers. So we create an attribute pointer specifying what attribute we're pointing to 
in the shader layout, how many values are used in the attribute, whats the data type, if it needs to be normalized, whats the total 
size of one entry for the shader, and at what offset the data will be found for the attribute. So for example if a shader is 
expecting a vector3 as its input for the position of the vertix, that means it only requires one attribute pointer which specifies 
that for the variable in layout 0, its passing 3 values, float types, with a total of 3* float size (since thats all its expecting) 
with an offset of 0 (sinze thats all there is).

To optimize this process we use Vertex Array Buffers in the case that there are different types of vertex shaders expecting different
types of inputs. Using Vertex Array Buffers enables us to configure everything only once as its saves those configurations in an 
array and we can the bind and unbind the VAOs and use the idices for different confirguration. This way we dont have to configure
everytime we need to switch. 

Additionally when making shapes out of primitive there are cases where many vertices overlap, in those cases we can discard the 
extra vertices and use Element Buffer Objects to tell the GPU in what order to draw the vertices. This saves processing of
unneccessary vertices. Element Buffers are similar to VBOs except they are ElementBuffer type, and the data it contains are the 
indices of the vertix data being used. The Vertex Array also saves the EBO's configuration as well so at the end we still only
need to bind unbind VAOs since they indirectly handle both EBOs and VBOs

This is how the data is passed to the first Shader in the Pipeline, the Vertex Shader. The vertex shader takes in a single vertex
and transforms the 3D coordinates into another form of 3D coordinates and allows for other basic processing of the vertex attributes.

Then the data is sent to the Geometry Shader, which is optional. It takes in a collection of vertices that form a primitive and 
has the ability to add more vertices to create other (or more of the same) primitives. For example adding a vertex in a side of a 
triangle to create two triangles. 

Then the primitive assembly takes place where it takes all the vertix data from the vertex (or geometry) shader and assembles all the 
points into primitives. (The vertex and geometry shaders just manipulate vertices, there are no actual shapes assembled before this)

The output of the primitive assembly is then sent to the rasterization stage where it maps the primitve shapes made onto the pixels
on the final screen resulting in fragments for the fragment shader to use.

The fragment shader takes in this data and calculates the final pixel color. This is where it takes into consideration of other factors
such as lighting etc.

Finally the data is sent to the last stage where alpha tests and blending is done.

Some of these stages can be manipulated by the programmer by writting shader code using openGLs Shader Language GLSL. For example 
the vertex shader and fragment shader has to be made by the progammer since there are no defaults, unlike the geometry shader stage, 
which is why its optional. Rasterization and Primitive Assembly can not be modified. 

These shaders are compiled at run time and linked together forming a Shader program, which then can be set as active and used in the 
render loop




The graphics pipeline 
----------------------
1 - Vertex Data
2 - Vertex Shader 
3 - Fragment Shader


Steps in generating a triangle
--------------------------------
1 - First we created an array with 9 elements. 3 points/vertices having 3 values for co-oridnates

2 - We generate a Vertex Buffer Object 

3 - We bind the Vertex Buffer Object to tell the GPU to keep memory for the Object.
Since this Buffer is an Array Buffer type, we let the GPU know as well. 
There are many types of Buffers and multiple types of buffers can be bind to the GPU, but only one buffer per type

4 - We then send the data to the GPU, we tell it which type of buffer data it is (Array), the size of data, actual data, and
a flag for how to use the data, in this case we use a Static_Draw type, since the data will be used a lot but wont change a lot.
There are other options as well.

5 - We then create a very basic vertex shader file with the .vert extension.

6 - We create a vertex shader object by telling opengl to create shader and mentioning what type, in this case Vertex Shader

7 - We send the soruce data in the .vert shader file to the vertex shader object 

8 - We compile the source shader code at run time and also add error checks and logs

9 - Repeat Step 5-8 but for a Fragment Shader type with a .frag file

10 - We then create a Shader Program object, this links all the compile shaders together and then activate the program.
The program basically links the outputs of each shader to the inputs to the next shader being used

11 - We also added the Attrib pointers for the shaders to use. This implementation is done after sending data to the VBO (step 4)
These are used to pass data to the Vertex Shader from the Vertex Buffer (layout = 0 etc.)
Refer to the VertexAttribPointer Parameter Details section.

12 - We then make a Vertex Array object, these are used to save configurations of different VBOs so that we do not have to 
configure each vertex buffer we make multiple times, only need to do it once and they will be saved in the VAO

13 - In our render loop we activate our shader program, bind the VAO (and indirectly bind the VBO as well) and finally draw the 
primitves we would like. In this case the triangles. There are other types of primitives as well.

Drawing a Rectangle 
--------------------
After the steps folowing the Drawing a Triangle section we 

1 - Add more vertices, this is so we can create a reactanlge from two triagles.
This would mean we have 6 vertices in total, but 2 of those overlap with each other and are the same.

2 - To optimize the process, we use an Element Buffer Object, and instead keep 4 vertices, dicarding the duplicated two vertices
The EBO is used to tell openGL in what order to draw the vertices by using their index in the Vertex buffer. 
This way we dont have to process the extra vertices and still have the same output.
For this we need an array of indices to tell openGL in which order to draw the vertices

3 - So we generate EBO after generating the VBO with the same way. 

4 - We also bind the EBO and send data to the EBO similar to the way we do for VBOs. Only difference is we use the Element Array type
and use indices for the data instead of using the Array type and using vertices for the data

5 - The VAO's also keep the EBO's in their configuration. We have to make sure that we unbind the EBO after unbinding the VAO 
or else those configurations wont be saved

6 - Finally instead of using DrawArrays call we use the DrawElements call in the render loop

VertexAttribPointer Parameter Details
--------------------------------------
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 3 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);  

1 - The first parameter specifies which vertex attribute we want to configure. 
Remember that we specified the location of the position vertex attribute in the vertex shader with layout (location = 0). 
This sets the location of the vertex attribute to 0 and since we want to pass data to this vertex attribute, we pass in 0.

2 - The next argument specifies the size of the vertex attribute. 
The vertex attribute is a vec3 so it is composed of 3 values.

3 - The third argument specifies the type of the data which is GL_FLOAT (a vec* in GLSL consists of floating point values).

4 - The next argument specifies if we want the data to be normalized. 
If we're inputting integer data types (int, byte) and we've set this to GL_TRUE, the integer data is normalized to 0 
(or -1 for signed data) and 1 when converted to float.

5 - The fifth argument is known as the stride and tells us the space between consecutive vertex attributes.
Since the next set of position data is located exactly 3 times the size of a float away we specify that value as the stride.
Note that since we know that the array is tightly packed (there is no space between the next vertex attribute value)
we could've also specified the stride as 0 to let OpenGL determine the stride (this only works when values are tightly packed).
Whenever we have more vertex attributes we have to carefully define the spacing between each vertex attribute

6 - The last parameter is of type void* and thus requires that weird cast.
This is the offset of where the position data begins in the buffer.
Since the position data is at the start of the data array this value is just 0.
